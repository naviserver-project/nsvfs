This is the nsvfs module for naviserver. It provides some replacement naviserver
routines which use the Tcl VFS to access the file system rather than the native
OS routines.

The advantage of using the Tcl VFS is that it's possible to then use 'starkit'
or simillar techniques to wrap everything that's needed for the webserver to run
into a single distributable which is ready to run without any instalation.

The disadvantage of using the Tcl VFS is that it's noticeably slower than
using the native OS routines and it complicates the naviserver core to
accommodate both mechanisms.

See sample-config.tcl for setup details.
